# py-bitcoin

Bitcoin related Python scripts. Will add to this over time.

The first script is a Python version of my [Bitcoin Price and Fees script](https://github.com/xannythepleb/go-bitcoin/blob/main/BitcoinPriceAndFees.go) from the [go-bitcoin repo.](https://github.com/xannythepleb/go-bitcoin)

It produces an almost identical output with the exact same information:

```

Choose an API to fetch Bitcoin price:

1. CoinDesk
2. CoinGecko
3. Bitfinex
4. Kraken
5. Binance

Enter your choice (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5): 5

  1 BTC = $26,476
  1 BTC = 1 BTC
